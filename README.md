# h5ToVTK
## Description
This utility is made to convert the Lagrangian and Eulerian output .h5 data files generated by [PARTIES](https://github.com/vowinckel/PARTIES) to standard .vtk format.
## Download and run
 _step 1_  - clone repository 
 `https://github.com/metialex/h5ToVTK.git`
 
 _step 2_ - run the executable file - `./dist/h5ToVTK` or python file `python3 h5ToVTK.py`

## Options
There are different flags which can be chosen as an input arguments: <br>
`-e -l -el` corresponds to different output files. With the first flag `-e` only Eulerian data (Data_x.h5) will be processed, while `-l` corresponds to Lagrangian data (Particle_x.h5). <br>
