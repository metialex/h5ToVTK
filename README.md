# h5ToVTK
## Description
This utility is made to convert the Lagrangian and Eulerian output .h5 data files generated by [PARTIES](https://github.com/vowinckel/PARTIES) to standard .vtk format. 
## Download and run
 _step 1_  - clone repository 
 `https://github.com/metialex/h5ToVTK.git`
 
 _step 2_ - run the executable file - `./dist/h5ToVTK` or python file `python3 h5ToVTK.py`

## Options
There are different flags which can be chosen as an input arguments: <br>
`-e -l -el` corresponds to different output files. With the first flag `-e` only Eulerian data (Data_x.h5) will be processed, while `-l` corresponds to Lagrangian data (Particle_x.h5) and with flag `-el` both output data types will be processed <br>

`-i` provides to choose the range of the anylized files, e.g. with `-e -i 2:5` files Data_2.h5, Data_3.h5, Data_4.h5, Data_5.h5 will be converted to .vtk format. <br>

`-d` used to extract certain data from Lagrangian particles and save it to corresponding .dat file. For example, `-d F` will excract the force _F_ from all Particle_x.h5 files and save it to three files _F0.dat_, _F1.dat_, _F2.dat_. These files contain three vectors components for each particle over time.
`-h` help flag shows all posible flags.

## Other
Pay attention that .vtk files are saved in ASCII format.
Right now it is impossible to specify several variables with `-d` flag, so if you want to extract several quantities from Lagrangian data files you have to run this application several times. <br>
Eulerian files must satisfy the following name pattern **Data_%i.h5** while Lagrangian files also have to match the simmilar pattern **Particle_%i.h5**
